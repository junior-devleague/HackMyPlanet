<p>*<em>Description of Course *</em><br>
This course opens up the world of connected devices using light programming in conjunction with modern micro hardware. Every day the world becomes more digitally connected with the “internet of things,” in which everyday objects are even more useful because they can connect to other devices across wifi networks. This course explores how to better understand how these devices work, work directly with the devices and learn how to connect hardware and software. Students learn to wire up electronics, some software to program the devices and how to connect them together.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>
Students with some experience in coding, and a desire to learn about the internet and hacking.</p>

<p><strong>Objective of the Course</strong>
This course will encourage students to understand the basic components of how to code and apply it to better understanding how hardware works. In addition, the course will teach students problem solving skills and teamwork which are highly important in the tech industry. This will culminate to a “project computer” which will include all of our functions which we have gone over in the class. They will be able to keep the computer, and continue to work on them on their own.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Philosophy</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This course will focus on three main areas. </p>

<p>Technology Literacy - Students will gain a deeper knowledge of technology through hands-on coding as well as learning how file systems, servers and databases work. </p>

<p>Collaboration - Students will be working in teams to develop communication and cooperative skills which are critical in today’s workforce.</p>

<p>Problem solving - Students will learn problem solving skills to deal with stumbling blocks that focus on solutions, including how to identify issues, troubleshoot and simplifying systems.

<strong>Course Requirements</strong>
This course needs to be able to network the Raspberry Pi which each student will be using and keeping after the course. To be able to use the Raspberry Pi, a monitor with HDMI input, a usb keyboard and mouse will be necessary. Also the classroom will need a network hub and ethernet cables sufficient to connect each student together. DevLeague will provide the necessary software and course materials for the class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Class layout</strong>
The basic class will be two hour sessions and will have one overall theme with two or three challenges to teach that theme. Here is the basic structure of the class of the 120 minute class.</p>

<p>0-20 minutes
Introduction and discussion on today’s theme.
20-30 minutes
Explanation of the first challenge
30-60 minutes
Working the first challenge
60-80 minutes
Review and explanation of second challenge
80-110 minutes
Working the second challenge
110-120 minutes
Review and thought homework for next session</p>

<p>The introduction may include a warm up discussion of topical news in technology, or how the day’s theme may apply to the challenge of the day. The students are encouraged to listen to each other’s opinion on the subject and work from each other’s suggestions. The thought homework is to encourage students to think and observe how the lessons learned from the challenges apply to technology in their own world.</p>
